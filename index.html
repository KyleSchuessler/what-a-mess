Transgender Cultural 
Competency and Humility for 
Direct Service Providers
Breaking It Down
"describes"
 -- Transgender is an adjective, not a noun. 

"gender identity"
 -- This refers to the gender that a person knows themselves to be based on their own personal feelings and experiences. 

"sex assigned at birth"
 -- This refers to the sex that a person was assigned based on the physical appearance of their genitalia at birth. This is usually what is recorded on a person's birth certificate. 
Who are we 
talking about when 
when we say transgender?
Transgender women --
women
 who were assigned male at birth 

Transgender men -- 
men
 who were assigned female at birth 

Nonbinary trans individuals -- individuals who do not identify as male or female

Genderfluid

Pronouns
Pronouns are words used to refer to a person without using their name. 

The most common sets of pronouns are she/her/hers and he/him/his. 

Some people use other sets of pronouns. 

Using the correct pronouns is a small but 
very important
 way to respect transgender people's identities. 
Using Gender Neutral Pronouns
They/them/theirs

Example:
 They went to the store to buy cupcakes for their coworkers. 

Example:
 That book belongs to them. 

Ze/hir/hirs


Example
: Ze received an A+ on hir project. 

Example
: The apartment with the patio is hirs.

1. Ally is not a self-proclaimed identity or a noun–it needs to be a constant practice/work in progress. 

2. Allies are mindful of the space that they take: 
a. Listen more, speak less.
b. Allies don’t need or expect to be in the spotlight.
c. Allies don’t take up emotional space that isn’t theirs. 

3. Allies educate themselves constantly, and don’t expect others to do it for them. 

4. Allies focus their work on those that share their identity.

5. When criticized or called out, allies listen, apologize, act accountably, and act differently going forward.
